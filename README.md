# Junior Engineer Code Test

To complete this code challenge, you will need to create an HTML page that renders the art
provided by the endpoint below from the Met Museum’s Public API.This API does not require
registration or an API key. Please render the image, the title of the art, and the artist’s name.
Please do not spend more than a couple hours on this task. We understand that this is not
enough time to create a polished application. Use this task to demonstrate your skills for the
area you’ll be working in (e.g., Front-End, Full Stack, Back-End). Use whatever framework or
designs you think help you accomplish this.
Once the task is complete, please push to a Github repository and share the link with your hiring
manager. Good luck!
